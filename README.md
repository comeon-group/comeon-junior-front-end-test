Applicant's test for junior front-end developers

# Your Assignment
The image above is a part of our current Casino lobby at ComeOn!

Your assignment is to re-create it with HTML and CSS. Don't forget that responsive is the new default so we expect your work to look good on both small and large screens.

Feel free to use a CSS pre-processor if you wish. Impress us a little extra by using a scalable CSS methodology like  BEM or SMACSS. 

# Assignment Criteria

We want to see how you approach and solve this task, we will look at code style and quality. Do take your time to do it right, rather than fast.

# How to Submit the Home Assignment

Please send us your code in a compressed file in an email.
